        <p class = "red" id = "bigger"> 1. I hate <mark>YuGiOh</mark>. I summon one little guy, and then my opponent plays a spell with five paragraphs of text plus footnotes and it says because I slept less than 8 hours last night he gets to summon Nutbuster Dragon or whatever and the game is over and I should just fuck off I guess.</p>
        <p> 2. Mannadium Prime-Heart has a special defensive ability that stops your opponent from targeting it with card effects. No monsters facing Mannadium Prime-Heart will be safe due to its multiple energy blades! Find this powerful card in Cyberstorm Access, releasing on May 5th!</p>
        <p> 3. if MY girl👸🥰😍 and <B class="FemaleList" title="Female dected"> Mo Ye</B> 🤑🤩 are both drowning 💦😫🌊 and i can only save one 😔☝️1️⃣ you can catch me at my girl’s funeral 😿☠️⚰️ revealing Wyrms in my hand 🤣🥞📚  ⛑️ and summoning tokens  💥 TO SYNCHRO INTO CHIXIAO 🥷🙈 AND ADD LONGYUAN TO MY HAND❗️❗️</p>
        <p> 4. Oh my God, yes. I love <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">Raye</B>. I would die for <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">Sky Striker Ace Raye</B>. This support card is going to change my life and it's going to be the best card ever.</p>
        <p> 5. <INS>Secrets of Eternity was released in January 2015. This set introduced the Infernoids, a series of monsters that can Special Summon themselves to the field by banishing other Infernoids from either the hand or graveyard. Notable cards in set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort Monolith, Uni-Zombie, <b class = "FemaleList">Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</b>, and a card that would bolster Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight Constellar Diamond. In this series, both Nyhmnim and myself will be opening 24 booster packs or 1 box of a core <mark>Yu-Gi-Oh!</mark> booster set. We will build a deck and play a best 2 out of 3, and the winner will receive a small prize to upgrade their deck. HOWEVER! Each episode, we will open another box of the next set that was released moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading our decks before dueling each other at the end of each episode. This is the <mark>Yu-Gi-Oh!</mark> Progression Series.</INS></p>
        <p Id = "smaller"  > <I> <sub> 6. Alright.I know this sounds dumb.
        I know waifu decks existed and it's normal for people to be physically attracted to them. <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">Tears</B>, <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected"></B>, <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">sky strikers</B>...... but this is different.
        So, recently, I picked up this deck, called floowandereeze.
        Half of you gus probably already knew what deck is this.The bird stun deck that normal summons a lot with the lore of 3 traveling birds who went from north to south pole.Nothing remotely arousing about this, right?
        Or so I've thought.
        So, I heard about the deck, got the cards, and hopped on a few rounds of casual matches...
        Then I got utterly clapped.Due to me not even looking at the card once.
        I posted about that on reddit and people told me to look at the card and see the effects, so i did.
        Nothing interesting there, just some normal effects with some cute card arts of these birds-
        Than I saw her.
        Yes, the one with a hat.She probably doesn't have a name, since the wiki just says she's a part of the 'floowandereeze' species, but that's fine.I would just call her <B class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B>, since, well, that's a cute name for a girl bird like her.
        Well, in the moment I focused on her, something inside me triggered.My heart rate skyrockets, my face blushes......
        I'm in love.
        I am not a furry, but I've always been interested in birds.Having an ornithologist father, I was taught to love birds like family since I was a little kid.Dad would bring me to different fields and let me sketch those beautiful little angels while he does his research.Growing up,the love of birds inside me only grows.
        But not like this.
        </sub>
        <B class="FemaleList" title="Female dected">Floo</B> was different.She didn't gave me the 'nice bird!' type of fascination.Maybe it's the cute, simple eyes, maybe it's her cute hairstyle that coincidentally matches with my highschool crush, but I am falling in love with her.In a romantic way.
        Me, a fucking adult male, is falling for a fictional bird from a children's card game who doesn't even have an official name.
        This is beyond shameful.I know this is highly immoral and my parents would probably disown me if they found out my forbidden love towards <B Class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B>, but I can't resist it.I desperately tried to search for art of her but I just couldn't find it.I crave her.I wish to turn into a bird and build a nest with her, nesting a whole bunch of babies.I NEED her.
        After reading more cards and closely inspecting her, the passion that's burning inside me only became stronger.Her sassy, cheery attitude and dainty figure arouses something deep inside me.It's not the desire of body, rather than soul.I need her more after that.I wish she's real. <B Class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B> is now my life.I spent hours drawing her and sticking printed images of her and those paintings on the walls of my room so I could watch <B Class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B> 24/7.I called sick so that I could play with <B Class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B> on master duel.I am even spending money on an IRL <B Class = "FemaleList" title="Female dected">floo</B> deck just to make her sleep with me physically every night.
        It's crazy how one cute girl could change a man in a period this short.
        Is this normal?Heard some <mark>yugioh</mark> players also does this and they are doing fairly well...</p>

        <p Id = "SecretList" title="did you know..." > <small> <del> <sup> Hey guys. Did you know, in terms of male human and female YuGiOh monster breeding, the Tearlaments are the most compatible monsters for humans? Not only are they in the mermaids group, which is mostly comprised of hot womens, Tearlaments are an average of 5”7 tall and 115.9 pounds, this means they’re perfect for human dicks, and with their impressive resilient to handtraps for durability and ability to reconstruct their whole board after getting raigeki, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based attribute, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Kitkallos would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. </sup> </del> </small> </p>
